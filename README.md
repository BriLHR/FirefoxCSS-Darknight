  Looks extremely boring, and meant to be so.

  Unobtrusive highlighting of active tab.

## Installation 
- Refer to FirefoxCSS's [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/wiki/index/tutorials/) to find out how to use userChrome.css themes.
- Hide as many elements that you do not need to see on the toolbar for a clean layout (addons, flexible spacing, etc).

## In place of hidden buttons... 
- Close tabs by Ctrl+W
- Close Firefox with Ctrl+Q
- Traverse forward/backwards into the tab's history by Alt+Arrow Keys
- Bookmark pages by right clicking the tab
- Access bookmarks by Ctrl+B
- Usage of vim-like keyboard binding addons like [Vimium C](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-c) for more keyboard functionality
- Check out Firefox's keyboard shortcuts at their official site [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly).
